I am not aware if the bloglist app will be edited in future exercises beyond part 7. This part is only for part 7f, exerices 7.10-7.21. The backend and frontend folders are copied from their state before I arrived in this part.

Exercises 7.14 and beyond are done in the React Query and Context frontend
part4\blog-backend is also modified to allow for the requirements of these exercises
